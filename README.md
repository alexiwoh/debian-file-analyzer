# debian-file-analyzer
A python command line tool that takes the architecture (amd64, arm64, mips etc.) as an argument and downloads the compressed Contents file associated with it from a Debian mirror. The program parses the file and output the statistics of the top 10 packages that have the most files associated with them.

# Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x ./package_statistics.py
```

## ðŸš€ Run the app by typing this in the terminal

./package_statistics.py YOUR_ARCHITECTURE

### Examples:
```bash
./package_statistics.py amd64
```
```bash
./package_statistics.py arm64
```
```bash
./package_statistics.py mipsel
```
```bash
./package_statistics.py armel
```
```bash
./package_statistics.py i386
```
